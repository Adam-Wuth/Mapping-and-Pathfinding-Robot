# Mapping-and-Pathfinding-Robot
Hello!!
This is the final project I made in my robotics course at CU. It uses lidar to map an enviornemnt, and then A* search and image recognition to find the best path for moving objects from one location to another. Because this is a course project, I can't post the code, but feel free to take a look at this video.
